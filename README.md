# Understanding-and-Simplifying-Roots
A beginner and student-friendly way to understand and simplify roots which makes your root problems to be solved easily.
## Understanding and Simplifying Roots – A Student Framework

This repository documents a simple, logical framework I developed to
understand, simplify, reverse, and reason about roots without memorising
too many formulas.

The ideas here are based on factorisation, basic exponent rules,
and observation. The goal is clarity, not shortcuts.

This framework is suitable for Class 8–10 students
and aligns well with NCERT concepts.

## 1. Basic Observations about Roots

From standard rules of mathematics:

- √a × √a = a  
- √a × √b = √(ab)  
- √(a²) = a, where a ≥ 0  

These rules form the base of all simplifications.

---

## 2. The Main Identity (a²b Identity)

If a number inside a square root can be written as:

a² × b  

then,

√(a² × b) = a√b  

This identity explains why some roots can be simplified
and others cannot.

### Examples:
- √50 = √(25 × 2) = 5√2  
- √98 = √(49 × 2) = 7√2  
- √72 = √(36 × 2) = 6√2  

If no perfect square exists as a factor, simplification is not possible.

---

## 3. Reverse Root Concept

If a root is already in simplified form:

a√b  

then the original number under the root was:

a² × b  

This allows us to move backwards from a simplified root
to its original form.

### Example:
- 6√2 → original root = √(36 × 2) = √72  

---

## 4. Mutual Identity

A useful identity observed is:

√a × √a × √b = a√b  

Explanation:
- Two identical square roots combine to form a whole number
- One root remains

This identity helps justify the a²b identity logically
instead of memorising it.

---

## 5. Powers of Simplified Roots

If a root is already simplified, powers can be handled as:

(a√b)ⁿ = aⁿ × (√b)ⁿ  

For odd powers, one √b remains.
For even powers, √b disappears.

### Example:
(3√6)⁵  
= 3⁵ × (√6)⁵  
= 243 × 6² × √6  
= 8748√6  

---

## 6. Approximate Value of Roots (No Long Division)

To estimate the value of √x, the following approximation can be used:

√x ≈ a + (x − a²) / (2a)  

where:
- a is the nearest whole number whose square is close to x

This gives an approximate value, not an exact one.

### Example:
√50  
≈ 7 + (50 − 49)/14  
≈ 7.071  

---

## 7. Understanding Irrational Roots

A root is irrational if the number under it cannot be written
in the form a² × b where b = 1.

For example:
- √3, √2, √5 are irrational
- √100, √36 are rational

This framework helps identify irrational numbers
before attempting full proofs.

---

## 8. Applications

This framework can be used to:
- Simplify square roots
- Reverse simplified roots
- Work with powers of roots
- Estimate root values
- Support proofs of irrationality
- Solve board-level and Olympiad-style questions

---

## 9. Important Note

This framework does not replace standard mathematical proofs.
It is a learning and reasoning aid designed to make roots intuitive.

All results are consistent with standard mathematics.

## 10. Closing Note

This project represents my personal exploration of roots
through observation, practice, and logical reasoning.

It helped me understand *why* formulas work,
instead of just applying them.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome.
